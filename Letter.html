      <h2>To My Beloved Sam</h2>
      <p>
        As we celebrate this special milestone, I want to take a moment to express just how much you mean to me, Sam.

        Through every challenge we've faced, your patience and understanding have been nothing short of remarkable. I am truly grateful for the way you’ve stood by my side, even when times were tough.<br><br>

        I know that life hasn’t always been easy on us and especially you, but your choice to be with me, despite everything, fills my heart with so much joy and appreciation.

        You have shown me what love is like, and I am so lucky to have you in my life.
        <br><br>
        Thank you for being my rock, my confidant, and my greatest supporter. I cherish every moment we share, and I look forward to creating many more beautiful memories together.

        We both are still learning how to love each other and this distance is nothing when we are both consistent.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
        I know things have been hard on your end, let me remind you that there are people who care for you, truly care for you and sometimes you tend to strive away from that because you think that you don't deserve it or you think that it might just be pity but it's not, it is genuine and true. 

        I know this isn't much but I wanted to do something a bit special.
        <br><br>
        I'd like to spend as much time with you and I know your schedule is hectic sometimes and of course the timings aren't that great too but even the slightest interaction with you is enough for me, you have a good heart Sam and some would take advantage of that and not appreciate you at all but I do.
        <br><br>
        You are not annoying, okay? Your voice is cute and your giggles are contagious. I know you don't know how to take compliments but you do have a kind soul, you're pretty, patient, understanding, sometimes stubborn, goofy too, we both are comfortably weird, it's new isn't it? hearing such things from a different perspective.

        I love every part of you, flaws and everything.
      </p>
